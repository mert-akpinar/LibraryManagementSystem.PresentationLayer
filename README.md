Coding Challenge: Book Library Management System
Requirements:
<br/>
You are required to develop a Book Library Management System RESTful API, and the corresponding UI
using ASP.NET Core and EF Core, with the following features:<br/>
Book and Author CRUD operations: The API should enable create, read, update, and delete operations 
on Book and Author records.<br/>
Book search: The API should allow users to search for Books base<br/>d on various criteria, including title, 
author name, category, or any other relevant field.<br/>
Exception Handling: The API should handle exceptions gracefully and return informative error messages 
to users.<br/>
You are free to use any database, but we recommend SQL Server or SQLite. You may also use other tools 
or frameworks to facilitate the task. For the UI, you can use Razor pages or Razor Views, and JavaScript if 
desired.<br/>
Optional:<br/>
Category: You may add a category feature to the Book Library Management System using your 
preferred approach.<br/>
Authentication and Authorization: You may incorporate authentication and authorization 
mechanisms into the API to ensure that only authorized users can perform operations on the 
employees. You may use JWT tokens to implement this section.<br/>
Your coding submission must be production-ready and employ the best architecture practices you 
know, as if it were a large-scale application. You will be evaluated based on current software 
development best practices, including but not limited to SOLID, Clean Code principles, and edge-case 
handling. If you use GitHub, we encourage you to make as many meaningful commits as possible so 
that we can understand your thought process and development approach. Additionally, please 
provide API endpoint documentation and usage instructions.<br/>
Good luck!
